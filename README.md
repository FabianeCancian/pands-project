# Project description
This project concerns the well-known Fisherâ€™s Iris data set. The objective of this project is to thoroughly explore and analyse this dataset. 
By researching the dataset and examining existing investigations, we'll gain insights into its characteristics and potential uses. We'll document our findings and write code to dog into the data, breaking down the project into manageable tasks to ensure thoroughness and clarity. The ultimate goal is to understand the dataset comprehensively and uncover any valuable information it may hold.

You might do that for this project as follows:
1. Research the data set online and write a summary about it in your README.
2. Download the data set and add it to your repository.
3. Write a program called analysis.py that:
    - Outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file,
    - Saves a histogram of each variable to png files, and
    - Outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables.
4. Performs any other analysis you think is appropriate.

# Dataset description
The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is one of the most well-known and commonly used datasets in the field of machine learning and statistics.
The Iris flower data set is a multivariate dataset introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems.The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers from three different species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.  Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.
