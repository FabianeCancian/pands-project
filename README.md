# Project description
This project concerns the well-known Fisherâ€™s Iris data set. The objective of this project is to thoroughly explore and analyze this dataset. 
By researching the dataset and examining existing investigations, we'll gain insights into its characteristics and potential uses. We'll document our findings and write code to delve into the data, breaking down the project into manageable tasks to ensure thoroughness and clarity. The ultimate goal is to understand the dataset comprehensively and uncover any valuable information it may hold.

You might do that for this project as follows:
1. Research the data set online and write a summary about it in your README.
2. Download the data set and add it to your repository.
3. Write a program called analysis.py that:
    - Outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file,
    - Saves a histogram of each variable to png files, and
    - Outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables.
4. Performs any other analysis you think is appropriate.
